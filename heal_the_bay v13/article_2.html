        <p>81% of employees who volunteer together out of the office report stronger workplace relationships. In other words, the team that plays together, stays together.

          Now, imagine if that volunteer opportunity is OUTSIDE… at the beach.
          
          We invite you and your group to help clean the coast by sponsoring a private beach cleanup through our Suits on the Sand program. Your group will have the unique opportunity to explore marine pollution with a Heal the Bay educator – and then be part of the solution by participating in a private beach cleanup with interactive team-building activities and a healthy dose of friendly competition. There is a Suits on the Sand experience for organizations of all sizes.
