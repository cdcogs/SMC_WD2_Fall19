        <p>Curious about what kinds of trash we find at beach cleanups in Los Angeles County? The Marine Debris Database gives an inside look at the epidemic of single-use plastic pollution, cigarette butts, and more. We have more than 4,000,000 pieces of localized trash data points, so dig in!</p>
        <p>Search for the latest water quality information at your favorite beach using the Beach Report Card — an app that provides A-to-F water quality grades for more than 650 beaches along the Pacific Coast. Similarly, the River Report Card rates dozens of local freshwater recreation areas in Los Angeles County. Scientists at Heal the Bay also release a yearly report on local water quality trends.</p>
